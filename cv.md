### SHORT SELF INFORMATION:
I am 30 years old. The global goal for the next year is to change your profession and become a front-end developer.

**Education:** Belarusian State University of  Economics.

**Work experience:**
* JSC "Dokshitsky rayagroservice"
* Dokshitsky district Executive Committee
* The State Property Committee of the Minsk Regional Executive Committee.

I have been maturing for a long time to master a new profession, there can no longer be any progress in the previous field of work, and coordinated changes are necessary. 

I have a good logical thinking, mathematics was a favorite subject at school

I like: 
* to find reasons why something doesn't work, 
* to bring things to the end, I can sit on a task for a long time – the main thing is to reach the goal, 
* to improve algorithms so that instead of 100 steps, I go through 5. it to be beautiful-both in life and in the computer. 

There is an irresistible desire and ability to quickly learn and learn new things.

If I encounter a difficulty and it prevents me from completing the task – I will Google and ask for help, if they ask me for help, I will be happy to help! 

I know how to work in a team, I clearly understand what a deadline is and why it is so important not to let the team down.
